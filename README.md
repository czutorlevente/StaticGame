# Overview

I wanted to use pygame to draw certain diagrams on the screen depending on user input. First I was experimenting creating the menu in Pygame, but then I decided to just use the tkinter library for that. Due to the complex calculations and the loop inside the menu system, I came accross many bugs, which did not leave time for the pygame drawing part, but the program functions. It makes statical calculations, and once I finish it up, it will display them, calculating and showing moments, shear, support reactions, and loads. 

I wrote this because I thought it would be useful for my statics class.

# Development Environment

I used VS code and python programming language (experimented with pygame, and used tkinter a lot)

# Future Work

* Item 1 - It needs to display diagrams and drawings based on user input and calculations
* Item 2 - I need to include the pygame part
